# RegexJUnitAssignment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed to help practice working with **regular expressions (Regex)** and **JUnit testing** in Java. The goal is to understand and evaluate different regex patterns, implement them correctly, and write unit tests to verify their behavior.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Set up an **IntelliJ IDEA** project with Gradle.
- Learn how to **evaluate** and **implement** regex patterns.
- Write **Java code** to process and validate regular expressions.
- Develop **JUnit test cases** to verify regex functionality.
- Apply **unit testing techniques** to ensure correctness and edge-case handling.

## 📝 Assignment Breakdown

### **🔹 Part 1: Test Coverage**
- A pre-defined regex is provided for matching **email addresses**.
- The task is to write **JUnit test cases** to verify the regex behavior.
- A minimum of **five matching** and **five non-matching** test cases are required.
- Examples:
  - ✅ **Matching Cases:** `theLegend27@gmail.com`, `otherdomain@ufl.edu`
  - ❌ **Non-Matching Cases:** `missingdot@gmailcom`, `symbols#$%@gmail.com`

### **🔹 Part 2: Writing Custom Regex**
- Implement regex patterns for different scenarios:
  1. **Odd Strings:** Strings between 10-20 characters with an odd length.
  2. **Integer Lists:** Comma-separated positive integers within square brackets.
  3. **Decimals:** Two-integer decimal numbers with no leading zeros.
  4. **Strings with Escape Characters:** Double-quoted string literals.

- Each regex must be tested with:
  - **Minimum of 5 matching cases**
  - **Minimum of 5 non-matching cases**

### **🛠 Technologies Used**
- **Java**
- **JUnit 5** for unit testing
- **Gradle** for dependency management
- **IntelliJ IDEA** for development
